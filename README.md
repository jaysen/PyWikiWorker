PyWikiWorker (was going to be WikiThing)
===============================

Python tools for working with wikis. Initially will focus on standalone text based wikis - and have an interface implemented for WikidPad.

+++Initial Goals
Simple text based appending to wikipages, creating the WikiPage if necessary.
Will be invoked by AlfredScript and CommandLine and store in a flat-file local wiki, like WikidPad
